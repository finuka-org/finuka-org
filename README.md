# Finuka

Finuka is a software company that builds custom financial systems for organizations across Africa.

We create the technology behind microfinance institutions, SACCOs, digital lenders, and fintech startups. Our work includes building tools for lending, saving, digital wallets, and payments — all designed to meet the real-world needs of African markets.

We don’t offer financial services ourselves. Instead, we partner with financial service providers to build the platforms they run on. From backend systems to user interfaces, we focus on reliability, scalability, and relevance to local use cases.

We work with teams that need more than just off-the-shelf solutions. Whether launching a new product or upgrading an existing system, we help you build software that fits.
